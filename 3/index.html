        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Widowmaker equips herself with whatever it takes to eliminate her
          targets, including mines that dispense poisonous gas, a visor that
          grants her squad infra-sight, and a powerful sniper rifle that can
          fire in fully-automatic mode.

        <h2>Strength</h2>
        <p>
          Widowmaker is the archetypical sniper of Overwatch. Equipped with a
          powerful scoped rifle, she is capable of taking down the majority of
          the game's heroes with a single fully-charged headshot, and is still
          able to deal serious damage with bodyshots. Her Infra-Sight and Venom
          Mine give her and her team considerable information on enemy
          movements, allowing them to easily counter ambushes and coordinated
          pushes.
        </p>

        <h2>Weakness</h2>
        <p>
          Widowmaker is, however, relatively weak in close-range combat, and her
          immobility while scoped makes her an easy target; Widowmaker's biggest
          threat is often another, better Widowmaker on the enemy team. She's
          often forced to play away from the objective where she's safer, as her
          only real mobility is Grappling Hook which can have a long cast time
          and leaves Widowmaker fairly defenseless to another attack.
        </p>
